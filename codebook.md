# Modifications
the original data was modified by
- Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Replacing class label in the data set with descriptive activity name.
- Converting columns names of data set to 'descriptive'.
- Aggregating average of each measurement for each activity and each subject.

# Descriptions of variables on tidy data set
## Identifiers
The first two columns below are Identifiers.
- subject: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- activity: the Name of the Activity performed by the subject.

## Measurements
Keep orinal features which include string "std" or "mean". 
The name of each measurements modified as descriptive. 
(e.g. "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" -> "tBodyAccMeanX" : removing "-" and "()", replace "mean" to "Mean" respectively.)
Rows were aggregated average for each activity and each subject above.
